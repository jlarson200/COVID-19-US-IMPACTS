# COVID-19 US IMPACTS
## Capstone Project for DSCI 591, Fall 2020, team COVID-19 US Impacts.
### Introduction
The COVID-19 US impact team has formed to understand the impact that COVID-19 has had on employment in the United States. We are approaching this issue from several directions by examining:

1. Employment and unemployment rates
1. State policies that directly impact unemployment or underemployment
1. Housing changes
1. Impacts on gig economies (specifically Airbnb)
1. COVID-19 infection rates

For each of these (except the last) it is important to have data for both before the pandemic up until current time. We will also try to look at the results by sub-population, such as by race/ethnicity, gender, and locale (i.e., rural compared to metropolitan areas) to determine the different impacts across each group. The team is currently more focused on the development of the data acquisition, ETL, and analysis and less so on actual product/project creation at this phase of the effort.

We will use a variety of means to obtain, analyze and display the data we will be using to present our results. Data sources include the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for employment information, O\*NET for descriptions of occupations, InsideAirbnb for Airbnb rental rates, The U.S Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey for impacts on housing, The COVID Tracking Project for COVID-19 infection rates, and more will be identified as the project continues.

The team has an interest to learn how to use and follow the data science life cycle process as it pertains to COVID-19. This issue has a wide range of data availability and it is an ever developing world issue that the team can offer some understanding. In the end we are aiming to share a deeper understanding of how to ensure that data obtained is clean, usable, and analyzed following industry best practices so that the conclusions will withstand peer review, with manual modifications to the model.
